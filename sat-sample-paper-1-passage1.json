  "passage": "Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was\nthat it? Had he followed form\u2014had he asked his\nmother to speak to his father to approach a\ngo-between\u2014would Chie have been more receptive?\n\tHe came on a winter\u2019s eve. He pounded on the\ndoor while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,\nso at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid\nknew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,\nthe creak of the door. Then the maid brought a\ncalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.\n\tChie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she\nwas feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at\na low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt\nspread over the sides of the table so their legs were\ntucked inside with the heat.\n\t\u201cWho is it at this hour, in this weather?\u201d Chie\nquestioned as she picked the name card off the\nmaid\u2019s lacquer tray.\n\t\u201cShinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,\u201d she read.\nNaomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft\nintake of air.\n\t\u201cI think you should go,\u201d said Naomi.\n\tAkira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early\ntwenties, slim and serious, wearing the black\nmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he\nbowed\u2014his hands hanging straight down, a\nblack cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the\nother\u2014Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening\nsurface of the courtyard\u2019s rain-drenched paving\nstones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.\n\t\u201cMadame,\u201d said Akira, \u201cforgive my disruption,\nbut I come with a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\tHis voice was soft, refined. He straightened and\nstole a deferential peek at her face.\n\tIn the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.\nChie felt herself starting to like him.\n\t\u201cCome inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely\nyour business can wait for a moment or two.\u201d\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to trouble you. Normally I would\napproach you more properly but I\u2019ve received word\nof a position. I\u2019ve an opportunity to go to America, as\ndentist for Seattle\u2019s Japanese community.\u201d\n\t\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Chie said with amusement.\n\u201cThat is an opportunity, I\u2019m sure. But how am I\ninvolved?\u201d\n\tEven noting Naomi\u2019s breathless reaction to the\nname card, Chie had no idea. Akira\u2019s message,\ndelivered like a formal speech, filled her with\nmaternal amusement. You know how children speak\nso earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about\nthings that have no importance in an adult\u2019s mind?\nThat\u2019s how she viewed him, as a child.\nIt was how she viewed Naomi. Even though\nNaomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts\nneeded to make a good marriage, Chie had made no\neffort to find her a husband.\n\tAkira blushed.\n\u201cDepending on your response, I may stay in\nJapan. I\u2019ve come to ask for Naomi\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\tSuddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.\n\u201cDoes Naomi know anything of your . . .\nambitions?\u201d\n\t\u201cWe have an understanding. Please don\u2019t judge\nmy candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I\nask directly because the use of a go-between takes\nmuch time. Either method comes down to the same\nthing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your\nconsent, I become Naomi\u2019s yoshi.* We\u2019ll live in the\nHouse of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to\nAmerica, to secure a new home for my bride.\u201d\n\tEager to make his point, he\u2019d been looking her full\nin the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. \u201cI see\nI\u2019ve startled you. My humble apologies. I\u2019ll take no\nmore of your evening. My address is on my card. If\nyou don\u2019t wish to contact me, I\u2019ll reapproach you in\ntwo weeks\u2019 time. Until then, good night.\u201d\n\tHe bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless\ngrace, like a cat making off with a fish.\n\t\u201cMother?\u201d Chie heard Naomi\u2019s low voice and\nturned from the door. \u201cHe has asked you?\u201d\n\tThe sight of Naomi\u2019s clear eyes, her dark brows\ngave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were\npreposterous.\n\t\u201cWhere did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He\nthinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to\nAmerica all in the snap of his fingers!\u201d\n\tChie waited for Naomi\u2019s ripe laughter.\nNaomi was silent. She stood a full half minute\nlooking straight into Chie\u2019s eyes. Finally, she spoke.\n\u201cI met him at my literary meeting.\u201d\n\tNaomi turned to go back into the house, then\nstopped.\n\t\u201cMother.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI mean to have him.\u201d\n* a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her\nfamily\u2019s name",
