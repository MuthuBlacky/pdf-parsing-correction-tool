  "passage": "Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in\nfull force\u2014both online and on foot\u2014searching\nfrantically for the perfect gift. Last year, Americans\nspent over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of\nDecember alone. Aside from purchasing holiday\ngifts, most people regularly buy presents for other\noccasions throughout the year, including weddings,\nbirthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby\nshowers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can\nengender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers. Many\nrelish the opportunity to buy presents because\ngift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger\nbonds with one\u2019s closest peers. At the same time,\nmany dread the thought of buying gifts; they worry\nthat their purchases will disappoint rather than\ndelight the intended recipients.\n\tAnthropologists describe gift-giving as a positive\nsocial process, serving various political, religious, and\npsychological functions. Economists, however, offer\na less favorable view. According to Waldfogel (1993),\ngift-giving represents an objective waste of resources.\nPeople buy gifts that recipients would not choose to\nbuy on their own, or at least not spend as much\nmoney to purchase (a phenomenon referred to as\n\u2018\u2018the deadweight loss of Christmas\u201d). To wit, givers\nare likely to spend $100 to purchase a gift that\nreceivers would spend only $80 to buy themselves.\nThis \u2018\u2018deadweight loss\u201d suggests that gift-givers are\nnot very good at predicting what gifts others will\nappreciate. That in itself is not surprising to social\npsychologists. Research has found that people often\nstruggle to take account of others\u2019 perspectives\u2014\ntheir insights are subject to egocentrism, social\nprojection, and multiple attribution errors.\n\tWhat is surprising is that gift-givers have\nconsiderable experience acting as both gift-givers and\ngift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend\neach time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift.\nIn the present research, we propose a unique\npsychological explanation for this overspending\nproblem\u2014i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they\n\tspend with how much recipients will appreciate the\ngift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a\ngift-recipient\u2019s feelings of appreciation). Although a\nlink between gift price and feelings of appreciation\nmight seem intuitive to gift-givers, such an\nassumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose\nthat gift-recipients will be less inclined to base their\nfeelings of appreciation on the magnitude of a gift\nthan givers assume.\n\tWhy do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely\nlinked to gift-recipients\u2019 feelings of appreciation?\nPerhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more\nexpensive) gifts convey stronger signals of\nthoughtfulness and consideration. According to\nCamerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a\nsymbolic ritual, whereby gift-givers attempt to signal\ntheir positive attitudes toward the intended recipient\nand their willingness to invest resources in a future\nrelationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be\nmotivated to spend more money on a gift in order to\nsend a \u201cstronger signal\u201d to their intended recipient.\nAs for gift-recipients, they may not construe smaller\nand larger gifts as representing smaller and larger\nsignals of thoughtfulness and consideration.\n\tThe notion of gift-givers and gift-recipients being\nunable to account for the other party\u2019s perspective\nseems puzzling because people slip in and out of\nthese roles every day, and, in some cases, multiple\ntimes in the course of the same day. Yet, despite the\nextensive experience that people have as both givers\nand receivers, they often struggle to transfer\ninformation gained from one role (e.g., as a giver)\nand apply it in another, complementary role (e.g., as\na receiver). In theoretical terms, people fail to utilize\ninformation about their own preferences and\nexperiences in order to produce more efficient\noutcomes in their exchange relations. In practical\nterms, people spend hundreds of dollars each year on\ngifts, but somehow never learn to calibrate their gift\nexpenditures according to personal insight.\nGivers\u2019 Perceived and Recipients\u2019\n\tActual Gift Appreciations\nMean appreciation\n\tgiver\nrecipient\n\tRole\nless                   gift\nmore                   gift\n\texpensive\nexpensive",
